CircuitPython driver for LCD FeatherWing
========================================

This is a library for using the LCD FeatherWing by Oddly Specific Objects (coming soon). The `LCDWingLite` class supports the standard LCD glass, but you can also subclass the `BU9796Lite` class to drive other LCD glass designs driven by the BU9796 segment LCD controller.

Dependencies
=============

* [Adafruit CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython)
* [Adafruit Bus Device](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice)

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem. This is easily achieved by downloading [the Adafruit library and driver bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle).
